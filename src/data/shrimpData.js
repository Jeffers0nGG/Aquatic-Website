// FAQ data
export const faqData = [
    {
        id: 1,
        question: "Do you offer shipping or only local pickup?",
        answer: "Currently we offer local pickup only to ensure the health and safety of our shrimp. We're located in the metro area and can arrange convenient pickup times. Shipping options may be available in the future."
    },
    {
        id: 2,
        question: "What is your DOA (Dead on Arrival) policy?",
        answer: "We guarantee all shrimp are healthy at the time of pickup. If you follow proper acclimation procedures and experience losses within 24 hours, please contact us with photos and we'll work with you to resolve the issue."
    },
    {
        id: 3,
        question: "How should I acclimate new shrimp to my tank?",
        answer: "We recommend the drip acclimation method over 1-2 hours. Float the bag to temperature match, then slowly drip tank water into the container. Shrimp are sensitive to parameter changes, so slow acclimation is crucial for success."
    },
    {
        id: 4,
        question: "Can I mix different color varieties together?",
        answer: "Yes, all Neocaridina varieties can be kept together as they're the same species. However, they will interbreed and offspring may revert to wild-type coloration. For maintaining specific colors, keep varieties separate."
    },
    {
        id: 5,
        question: "What's the difference between grades?",
        answer: "Grading refers to color intensity and coverage. Standard grade has lighter coloration, Sakura/High Grade shows more solid color, Premium has deep consistent color, and Show Grade represents the highest quality with opaque, uniform coloration throughout."

        question: "What size tank do I need?",
        answer: "A minimum of 5 gallons is recommended, though 10+ gallons provides more stable parameters. Shrimp have a very low bioload, so you can keep a good-sized colony in a small tank with proper filtration."

        question: "Can I keep shrimp with fish?",
        answer: "Yes, but choose peaceful, small fish that won't eat shrimp. Good tank mates include Otocinclus, Corydoras, and small schooling fish like Neon Tetras. Avoid aggressive or large fish that might prey on shrimp or shrimplets."
